## About
Attempts to improve color scheme readability for all users on site Ultimate-Guitar.com. Original background - white on black - complained about by regular users. At some point in time, only UG Black was available; UG Classic was a non-option. Some people strongly protested this on work and medical grounds. If there were only one option of the color scheme available, these may have served as compromises between the two.
